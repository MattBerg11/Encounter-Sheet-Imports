**v1.5** *(6/24/18)*

Per usual I took too long with me recent update. This is a big one so I hope it makes up for the delay in the new manuals! 

&nbsp;

I would love to have some input from users on what they think needs to be changed or added. After submitting this file, I'm going to begin work in a single page monster sheet. This will be extremely beneficial for boss level monsters that have a large traits/actions section. After that, I would like to work on an initiative order page! That sounds like a fun challange so I hope it turns out well. I appreciate everyones support and thank you for using my sheet! You can contact me at the GitHub link below, or you can message me on Reddit @ /u/Shwaffle. 

&nbsp;

I have also put all of the monster information up on my Github. You can view all of the data and submit errors at: https://github.com/Shwaffle/Encounter-Sheet-Imports

&nbsp;

**Fixes**

* Fixed the font size of Speed so it's actually readable.
* Encounter XP was only pulling the XP from the top monster. I am very sorry for those that relied on this and were given the wrong information.
* Previous versions of the sheet would disable form highlighting for Adobe globally. This has been fixed to re-enable form highlighting on close.
* Fixed a lot of errors in Monster Imports
* 
Additions

* Added Tome of Beasts.
* Added Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes.
* Added The Tortle Package.
* Added radio buttons at the top to select whether or not you would like Adobe's field highlighting. I think it looks better off, but choose what you'd like!
* Added some nice icons for the manuals you select.

**v1.4** *(2/18/18)*

**Fixes**

* I really, really broke actions in 1.32 somehow. This has been fixed, and I can't believe I hadn't noticed earlier.
* Fixed multiple Spellcasting blocks.
* STR mod had a 2 character limit, which broke when monsters had anything over +9 to the mod. This has been fixed.
* Fixed a lot of data issues that weren't properly coded.

**Additions/Changes**

* Redid the manual selections at the top, this will allow for a lot more adaptability.
* Manually changing the ability score now modifies saves and mods.
* Added a bunch of tooltips!
* Added Out of the Elemental Evil (Out of the Abyss), Tyranny of Dragons (Hoard of the Dragon Queen, Rise of Tiamat), Curse of Strahd, Storm Kings Thunder, and Yawning Portal.
* Added a lot of missing monsters, thank you to those who have let me know!
* Added encounter name and location at the top, suggested by users!
* Underneath the monster's name you can now select a checkbox to manually change the name of the monster without it killing the stats. Suggested by users!
* Added Type & Subtype if applicable!
    * You can now search for a monster name! 
    * It is case sensitive
* Adobe DC currently has a bug that makes this feature not 100% reliable. However, being able to search in the dropdown should help a significant amount with the major manuals.


Going to be working hard to get Tome of Beasts complete before Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes is released in May.
