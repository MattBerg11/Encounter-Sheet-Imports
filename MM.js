Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year) and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.",
					"To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit."
